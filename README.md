## Why did i do the API?
For me,  
*i love writing code*,  
for him  
*After legal measures, Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram blocked my accounts. In order to use Instagram
 on my phone i needed a new phone, as they banned my UDID, so that is basically why i made this API.*

### What is Instagram?
According to [the company](https://instagram.com/about/faq/):

> "Instagram is a fun and quirky way to share your life with friends through a series of pictures. Snap a photo with your mobile phone, then choose a filter to transform the image into a memory to keep around forever. We're building Instagram to allow you to experience moments in your friends' lives through pictures as they happen. We imagine a world more connected through photos."
