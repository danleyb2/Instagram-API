## Steps for creating good issues or pull requests.

**Pull requests are highly welcome** but (*please read below*)

I might never be able merge some pull requests because of maintenance issue,  
I try very hard to make this repo an exact replica of the [PHP](https://github.com/mgp25/Instagram-API) side from the 

- Variable names (i dont follow PEP standards)
- Folder structure
- Namespaces
- Order of functions in a class
- Package name


I have achieved that by bringing changes to this side in the same order as they are made on the php side.

For example,  
At the time of making this guidelines, this repo is ~exactly similar to the php side at this [commit](https://github.com/mgp25/Instagram-API/commit/d4ae5128465122bbdd00cca38d5e128021be481b),
that is this [commit](https://github.com/danleyb2/Instagram-API/commit/6cc185b4db1b2422db498de91b7af15357e5e590) on this python side.
So if your change is already on the php side due to a later commit like say [this](https://github.com/mgp25/Instagram-API/commit/f5fce0ce7fec1d0e4325a4f1d0cbcec674b3c43f),
i wont be able to **merge** because i believe it will be replicated to this side when its reached and i dont want to get confused then


**But you are always free to fork and do anything you want to your fork**

Thank you.
